Together, Markov Chain Monte Carlo is a group of algorithms that help form a probaility distribution. An example of a use of this is the Ising model. The Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism and it consists of many discrete variables that are the magnetic dipole moments of atomic spins. These spins can be represented in 2 states, +1 or -1. MCMC could provide a distrubtion of the spins because the spins next door to each other will affect the characteristic (+1 or -1) of each other.*"
